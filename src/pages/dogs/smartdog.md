But it’s a completely different color! I wasn't dumped! She just wasn't taking my phone calls. Or seeing me... Ever. Oh, come on. It wasn't that hard to see that coming, even for a layman like me! You're saying that if something isn't normal, it simply isn't possible? Where does that leave the porcu-headed lawyer and the topknot chick over there... and the ungodly cool guy with the mask over here? Well, Trite? When this case is over, I'll roll over for you all you want. Don't just stand there 'hmm'-ing to yourself! OBJECTION! Go away!

Ack! NONONO! I'm not thinking of hiring... My feelings for you. If I had found out that she planned to kill you… …I would have done whatever was neccesary to stop her. Even if it meant her life… or mine. Someday you'll come to understand... the importance of thinking for yourself.

Heh heh heh- (whipped) OU-OU-OUCH! Proof enough for you, Mr. Sahwit? Or should I say... Mr. Did It! The sky is blue, and so am I... Yes, your reputation precedes you. What kind of cases have you dealt with so far? Whaaaaat?! Pearly wouldn't lie! Pearly's a way more honest person than I'll ever be! Well, we know whose milkshake brings all the boys to the yard... Franziska, I'd like to ask you about the investigation...
